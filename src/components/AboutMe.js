            <p>
                My name is August but I usually just go by Gus. When I graduated high school in 2016, I didn't know where to go next.
                 I didn't really have a set career path that interested me so while I was figuring out what I wanted to do in life, I decided to work at Lunds & Byerlys in the meantime.
                 Once I discovered programming I knew that it was something I wanted to pursue more of. It's fun to be constantly learning new things and ways to problem solve. 
                 I attended the University of Minnesota's Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp and graduated as part of the 10th Cohort in May 2019 with a passion and determination to further my skillset.
